This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming involving multiple mutable borrows. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to have two mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable (`x`) simultaneously. This violates Rust's borrowing rules and results in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a corrected version, showcasing how to avoid this issue.
